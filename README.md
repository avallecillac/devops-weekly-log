Weekly logs of a DevOps guy avoiding the boat to sink

The motivation of opening this space comes from the daily basis issues that a “DevOps Engineer” struggles with every day. It’s an endless landscape of production support, development issues, unexpected situations that make your day everything but boring. So, I’ll be sharing all my achievements and notes of a week work.

Personally, I enjoy this kind of job. Most people get tired of being a fireman. I don’t. I have been able to organize my work in a way that I can taste all flavors and never get tired of one specific. Everyday I develop software, help my team to sort out unexpected issues, train people in my company or team, handle production tickets among others.
